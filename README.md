Daisy Intelligence Hackathon Solution 2022


## What is bicyc-L?
bicyc-L uses a predictive Machine Learning model to rate the City of Toronto’s bike racks as ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’, to provide riders with guidance on secure parking locations

## What datasets were used?
The Toronto Police Service Bike Theft and Toronto’s Outdoor High-Capacity Bike Parking datasets were combined.

## What libraries were used?
Numpy, Pandas, and Regex were used for data manipulation. Knime was used to create and train the model.

## What ML model was used?
bicyc-L uses a generalized linear regression model due to its simplicity and accuracy.

## How was the UI created?
The user interface was modelled in Figma. You can access the prototype here:
